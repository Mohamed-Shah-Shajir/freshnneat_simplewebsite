            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <div class="intro-card">
                <p>
                Established in 2005, Fresh n Neat Hotel began as a modest, family-run hospitality venture with a heartfelt mission — to provide travelers with a clean, cozy, and welcoming space that feels just like home. What started with a few rooms and a dedicated team of passionate hosts has now flourished into one of the city's most trusted and well-loved hotels. Our founders believed that true hospitality lies in the details — from the warmth of a smile at check-in to the comfort of a perfectly made bed — and that philosophy continues to guide us every day.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Over the years, we’ve expanded our services, upgraded our facilities, and embraced innovation without losing the personal touch that our guests appreciate. Today, Fresh n Neat Hotel is known for its blend of traditional values and modern convenience. Whether it’s business travelers seeking efficiency, families looking for comfort, or tourists eager to explore the city, we cater to every guest with the same level of care and commitment. With elegant interiors, a serene ambiance, and a dedicated staff, we continue to redefine comfort and hospitality—making every stay a memorable one.
            </p>
            <p>
                From humble beginnings, we’ve evolved into a full-service hotel that caters to both business and leisure guests. With thoughtfully designed rooms, an in-house restaurant, spa, and personalized service, Fresh n Neat continues to provide a peaceful and refreshing stay for every guest who walks through our doors.
